# refinement:
# either based on boundary refinement (discretization of the boundary), e.g., boundary
# point density in the `boundary` file; or,
# based on local boundary curvature.
# In development: there is no current parametric representation of the boundary curvature
# if boundary_refine is True, then curvature_refine is false, and vice-versa.

# always one or the other, boundary_refine has quad tree refine to parameteric 
# representation of curve, and feature_refine is based on curvature.
