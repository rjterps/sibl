## Introduction

Pixel To Geometry (PTG) is the process of using stacked 2D image data, composed of pixels, to reconstruct a 3D object (e.g., 
a curve in 3D, a surface in 3D, or a volume).
PTG describes a **decoding** process of a physical system that was original **encoded** into a series of 2D medical images.  

## Questions

* H0: Segmentation based on threshold pixel intensity (quantisation) is sufficient to classify bone versus non-bone in the IRCAD data set based on ground truth F1-score.

## Road map

* Encode/Decode [unit test font](unit-test-font.md)
* Encode/Decode [unit test](unit-test.md)
* Tri-quadratic quarter cylinder [unit test](unit-test-triquad-qtr-cyl.md)
* Encode/Decode [unit test femur](unit-test-femur.md)
* Encode/Decode femur, patella, tibia, fibula
* Encode/Decode human skeleton

## Decode Workflow

1. Segmenting the CT (bone vs not bone) - is threshold-based segmentation good enough?
2. Stack the slices
3. Classify the bones in the masks - Chad will generate binary (0 and 1 only) slices that we will use for training. Initially will be for numbers and letters.

## Design

* Object-oriented programming (OOP) as a default, functional programming (FP) where appropriate.
