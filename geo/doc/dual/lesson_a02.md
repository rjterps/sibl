# MATLAB workflow

## Goals

Use MATLAB and text file interop to run the C++ engine and post-process results.

## Steps

Generate an input YML file which will specify to the engine what procedures to do. For this example, use [`circle.yml`](circle.yml). Running the executable will automatically generate a template YML file that you can modify.

Open [`plotCircleEx.m`](plotCircleEx.m)In Matlab editor to see the steps. Run from the editor or command line.

A figure similar to that created in Lesson 03 should appear again for this lesson:
