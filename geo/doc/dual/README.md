# Lessons

Below are lessons that demonstrate how to use the *SIBL Mesh Engine*.

* Configuration
  * [00](lesson_00.md). Verify the [configuration](../../../config/README.md).
* Introduction
  * [01](lesson_01.md). Plot a 2D boundary, the first step in meshing a 2D domain.  This will be done interactively with a Python terminal.
  * [02](lesson_02.md). Next, plot the same 2D boundary using a Python script.
  * [03](lesson_03.md). Use the 2D boundary as an input to the mesher, to create a single domain composed of 2D quadrilateral finite elements.
* Unit Tests
  * To come.
* Comparison to Examples in Literature
  * [21](lesson_21.md). The `flower` domain.
