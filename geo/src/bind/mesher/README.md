# Smallshire Tutorial

## Goals

* [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org) Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
* wrap *conforming and constrained triangulations*

```python
# import outer_Python_module.inner_Python_module_in_C++
import mesher.cgal_mesher  
```

## Workflow Overview

* into 2D domain, insert vertex as (x, y) point pair
* a constraint is a straight edge between two points, chained to create a closed loop
* rule: no triangulation can cross a constraint edge
* mesher: wraps around a triangulation, and understands seed points
* seeds allow control of include or exclude certain triangles in the triangulations
* conform to the 
  * Delaunay property by inserting new vertices
  * Gabriel property by inserting new vertices
  * mesh refinement minimum angle constrain and maximum edge length
  * Lloyd optimization

## Prerequisites

* VS Code extension: [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) by Microsoft, Extend CMake support in Visual Studio Code
* CMake [installation](https://cmake.org/install/)
  * Linux, macOS, and Windows pre-compiled [binaries](https://cmake.org/download/)
  * copy `CMake.app` into the `/Aplications` folder, then run it and follow the Tool mesh item "How to Install for Command Link Use", which makes `cmake` available in the `PATH`.
    * macOS: `cmake-3.21.4-macos-universal.dmg`
    * `PATH="/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin":"$PATH"` in `~/.bash_profile`
    * Alternative: manually add the install directory, `/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin` to the PATH
    * Alternative to pre-compiled binaries is to download the CMake source and build CMake.
* CGAL library [binaries](https://www.cgal.org/download.html)
  * Since version 5.0, CGAL is a header-only library by default, which means there is no need to build CGAL prior to its use.  However, some CGAL dependencies must still be installed.
  * `> brew install cgal` on macOS version 5.3
    * installs to `/usr/local/lib/cmake/CGAL`
  * cgal documentation on [installation](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/usage.html)
  * `> brew cleanup`
  * `sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local/* && sudo chmod -R g+rwx /usr/local/*`
* CGAL has the following prequisites
  * a supported [compiler](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/thirdparty.html#seccompilers)
    * *to build a program with CGAL, C++14 or later is required; CGAL 5.3 is continuously tested on the following OS/compiler combinations*
      * Linux
        * gnu g++ 8.3 or later
        * clang compiler version 11.1.0
      * Mac
        * gnu g++ 8.3 or later
        * Apple clang compiler versions 10.0.1 and 12.0.0
      * Windows
        * gnu g++ 8.3 or later
        * MS Visual C++ 14.0, 15.9, 16.10 (Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019)
 * CMake
 * Boost
 * GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic (GMP) and GNU Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliably (MPFR) Libraries
   * https://gmplib.org/

#### GMP

Download `gmp-6.2.1.tar.xz` and unzip to `~/Downloads/gmp-6.2.1`

```bash
> cd ~/Downloads/gmp-6.2.1
> ./configure
...
configure: summary of build options:

  Version:           GNU MP 6.2.1
  Host type:         haswell-apple-darwin20.6.0
  ABI:               64
  Install prefix:    /usr/local
  Compiler:          gcc

```

Run self-tests

```bash
make check

Install to default location of `/usr/local`

```bash
make install
...

### brew updates

```bash
[sparta ~]$ brew doctor
Please note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers
with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is
working fine: please do not worry or file an issue; just ignore this. Thanks!

Warning: Your Command Line Tools are too outdated.
Update them from Software Update in System Preferences or run:
  softwareupdate --all --install --force

If that does not show you any updates, run:
  sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
  sudo xcode-select --install

Alternatively, manually download them from:
  https://developer.apple.com/download/all/.
You should download the Command Line Tools for Xcode 13.0.
```

```bash
> softwareupdate --all --install --force

### cgal quickstart

Following the [quickstart](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/usage.html#secgettingcgal), download the examples [here](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/download/v5.3/CGAL-5.3-examples.tar.xz), then extract and move to `$HOME`, then

```bash
> cd $HOME/CGAL-5.3/examples/Triangulation_2 # go to an example directory

> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release . # configure the examples

### Download CGAL for macOS

* package manager (tried that above, but not finding GMP)
* with source archive

#### Source Archive

* ref: https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases
* CGAL-5.3 released 2021-06-06
* installation ref: https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/usage.html
  * tried 1: quick start with 2: prerequisites
    * `>cd ~; rm -rf CGAL-5.3` and start fresh
  * now try 3: "Using CGAL Source Archive"
    * download `CGAL-5.3.tar.xz` (22.2 MB) from [here](https://www.cgal.org/download.html) and unpack `>tar xf CGAL-5.3.tar.xz`
    * move the `CGAL-5.3` folder from `Downloads` to `~`
    * creates a `CGAL-5.3` directory as follows:

|Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| auxiliary (Windows only) | precompiled GMP and MPFR for Windows
| cmake/modules | modules for finding and using libraries
| demo |demo programs (most of them need Qt, geomview or other third-party products)
| doc_html | documentation (HTML)
| examples | example programs
| include | header files
| scripts | some useful scripts (e.g. for creating CMakeLists.txt files)
| src | source files auxiliary (Windows only) | precompiled GMP and MPFR for Windows
